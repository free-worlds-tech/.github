_Welcome to the Free Worlds Technical Institute. Since Captain-General Janos Marik signed the law establishing our institution in 3023, we have been the premier educational research facility in the Free Worlds League. In our first decade, we helped to understand and distribute the Star League technologies contained in the Helm memory core, and since those early years, we have continued to work closely with the FWLM and industrial partners such as Diverse Optics, Earthwerks-FWL, and Irian Technologies to push forward the boundaries of physics, engineering, chemistry, and other applied fields._

This organization is a place for fans of BattleTech to share projects related to the tabletop game and its setting.
